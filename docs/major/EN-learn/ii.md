Previewing the textbook, pp. 28–32  为什么要用两个p?

The use of "pp." (plural) instead of just "p." (singular) is a convention in academic and bibliographic writing to indicate a range of pages. "P." stands for "page," and "pp." stands for "pages." When you see "pp. 28–32," it signifies that the content or information spans from page 28 to page 32 inclusive. The use of the plural form helps to differentiate between a single page reference and a range of pages.
