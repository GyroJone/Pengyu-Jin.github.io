!!! note "Pointview of Prof. Hany Farid in the CS61A course"

    There is this notion that learning happens when you solve a problem. That is completely wrong. **Learning happens when you don't solve the problem.** The process of failure, the process of struggling, and the process of taking hours to solve something are where the learning is happening.

    "Don't be frustrated by things not working. That’s the way it’s supposed to be. That’s what the process of learning is."
