## Why have you chosen this university?
Through the communication with the seniors, I was attracted by the academic atmosphere of Shanghai Jiaotong University.In my opinion,as one of the most famous universities in our country,it provides students with opportunities to further their study.So,that's the reasons.

## What are your plans for the next three years?
Well,first of all,I plan to read and explore as many research papers as possible to help myself get a better understanding of how to put my research into presentable results.And I also understand that graduate school study isn't all about research papers,so I plan to acquire necessary knowledge and skills to solve problems,either in my future academic pursuit or in my future career.
