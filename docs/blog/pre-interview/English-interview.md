## Please introduce youself briefly.
Good afternoon,dear professors,I'm very delighted to be here for this interview.First,let me introduce myself.

My name is jin-pengyu,I'm 22 years old.My hometown is in Henan.Currently,I am a student at Shanghai University of Electric Power,and my major is electrical engineering and its automation.I will graduate in May 2023 with a bachelor degree in engineering.

I have been working extremely hard to equip myself with professional knowledge.With a GPA of 3.65,I won the scholarship for three consecutive years.I am proficient in English,and have passed CET4 and CET6.

Although I did not have the opportunity to participate in scientific research at the undergraduate level, I have a strong self-learning ability, and I believe that I can do the basic work of graduate students.

That's all.Thank you.

## 请简要介绍下你自己
尊敬的各位老师，下午好。我非常荣幸能够参加这次面试，接下来我会简要介绍自己的个人情况。
我叫靳鹏宇，今年22岁，来自河南省安阳市，目前就读于上海电力大学电气工程及其自动化专业，我将于今年的5月份毕业，获得工程学士学位。
本科期间我勤奋刻苦，认真学习专业知识，积极主动了解行业发展走向，四年来的平均绩点为3.65，并且连续三年获得了本科生优秀奖学金。

## Why have you chosen this university(SJTU)?
Through the communication with the seniors, I was attracted by the academic atmosphere of Shanghai Jiaotong University.In my opinion,as one of the most famous universities in our country,it provides students with opportunities to further their study.So,that's the reasons.

## Tell some reasons for taking postgraduate exams?
First,I have utmost interest in electric power which plays a significant role in our daily life.And I have decided to commit myself to the study and research of electric power system throughout my life.Second,facing the energy reformation in the near future,I consider it a pleasure to be able to explore at the forefront of technology.So,I chose to pursue further studies.

## What are your plans for the next three years?
Well,first of all,I plan to read and explore as many research papers as possible to help myself get a better understanding of how to put my research into presentable results.And I also understand that graduate school study isn't all about research papers,so I plan to acquire necessary knowledge and skills to solve problems,either in my future academic pursuit or in my future career.

## How are you feeling right now?
I'm very very excited because I know it's the most important moment of my life.
## 你的目前心情怎么样？


## 你喜欢电气的哪个专业，为什么？
I prefer the direction of power system.The fundamental reason is that I met professor Hao Liangliang of Beijing Jiaotong University through the teacher's course.Then I deeply realized that the power system is closely related to people's lives.And in reality it is combined with protection devices, communication technology and automation devices,etc.,which is a very rich discipline. And along with the energy reform,the power system is also facing new challenges.

## 在学习生活中遇到压力如何调节？
I will exchange ideas with friends and teachers,communicate with parents to solve problems in life. In addition, I will exercise regularly to release stress and relax my mind.
