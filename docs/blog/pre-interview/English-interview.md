## Please introduce youself briefly.
Good afternoon,dear professors,I'm very delighted to be here for this interview.First,let me introduce myself.

My name is jin-pengyu,I'm 22 years old.My hometown is in Henan.Currently,I am a student at Shanghai University of Electric Power,and my major is electrical engineering and its automation.I will graduate in May 2023 with a bachelor degree in engineering.

I have been working extremely hard to equip myself with professional knowledge.With a GPA of 3.65,I won the scholarship for three consecutive years.I am proficient in English,and have passed CET4 and CET6.

Although I did not have the opportunity to participate in scientific research at the undergraduate level, I have a strong self-learning ability, and I believe that I can do the basic work of graduate students.

That's all.Thank you.

## 请简要介绍下你自己
尊敬的各位老师，下午好。我非常荣幸能够参加这次面试，接下来我会简要介绍自己的个人情况。
我叫靳鹏宇，今年22岁，来自河南省安阳市，目前就读于上海电力大学电气工程及其自动化专业，我将于今年的5月份毕业，获得工程学士学位。
本科期间我勤奋刻苦，认真学习专业知识，积极主动了解行业发展走向，四年来的平均绩点为3.65，并且连续三年获得了本科生优秀奖学金。此外，我积极锻炼基本的行业技能，通过了四六级考试，计算机二级证书等。本科期间我虽然没有参与相关的科研工作，但我参加了全国大学生数学建模大赛，并最终荣获市三等奖的成绩。

## Why have you chosen this university(SJTU)?
Through the communication with the seniors, I was attracted by the academic atmosphere of Shanghai Jiaotong University.In my opinion,as one of the most famous universities in our country,it provides students with opportunities to further their study.So,that's the reasons.

## 为什么选择我们学校（上交）？
通过和直系学长的交流讨论，我了解到交大的学术氛围非常的浓厚，因此非常向往。此外，在我看来，上海交大作为国内最著名的大学之一，它可以提供一流的学术平台，对于优秀的学生能给予更多研读深造的机会。因此我会选择上海交大。

## Tell some reasons for taking postgraduate exams?
First,I have utmost interest in electric power which plays a significant role in our daily life.And I have decided to commit myself to the study and research of electric power system throughout my life.Second,facing the energy reformation in the near future,I consider it a pleasure to be able to explore at the forefront of technology.So,I chose to pursue further studies.

## 你为什么选择读研，给出一些理由？
一方面，我对于电气专业有着浓厚的兴趣，并且认识到电力行业与人民的日常生活息息相关。通过本科阶段和老师的交流后，我也致力于从事电力系统方向的研究，坚信这是我一生的事业。另一方面，在双碳政策的大背景下，能源改革迫在眉睫，我很荣幸，也愿意致力于新型电力系统的建立。为了做到知行合一，因此我选择了考研。

## What are your plans for the next three years?
Well,first of all,I plan to read and explore as many research papers as possible to help myself get a better understanding of how to put my research into presentable results.And I also understand that graduate school study isn't all about research papers,so I plan to acquire necessary knowledge and skills to solve problems,either in my future academic pursuit or in my future career.

## 研究生三年你有什么规划？
我计划建立自己的知识体系，对专业课的知识内容达到融会贯通的地步。坚持知行合一，理论与实际相结合，对于11111

## How are you feeling right now?
I'm very very excited because I know it's the most important moment of my life.

## 你的目前心情怎么样？
我真的非常激动，因为我知道，此时此刻是我人生中最重要的时刻。

## Which discipline do you like in the electrical industry and why?
I prefer the direction of power system.The fundamental reason is that I met professor Hao Liangliang of Beijing Jiaotong University through the teacher's course.Then I deeply realized that the power system is closely related to people's lives.And in reality it is combined with protection devices, communication technology and automation devices,etc.,which is a very rich discipline. And along with the energy reform,the power system is also facing new challenges.

## 你喜欢电气的哪个专业，为什么？
我更喜欢电力系统分析这一学科，最根本的原因便是，在本科阶段，我在网上结识了北交大的郝亮亮老师，通过老师的线上课程学习，我对于电力系统有了更深层次的认识，它并不是简单的理论分析，在实际生活中，从发电并网到线路检修，它与我们的生活息息相关。此外，实际的电力系统还包含保护装置，通信设备，电力电子自动化装置等，深入学习会发现是一门很丰富，很接地气的学科。并且伴随着能源改革，电力系统正面临这巨大的困难，极具挑战性也是我喜欢这门学科的原因。

## How to adjust the pressure encountered in study life?
I will exchange ideas with friends and teachers,communicate with parents to solve problems in life. In addition, I will exercise regularly to release stress and relax my mind.

## 在学习生活中遇到压力如何调节？
我会主动和老师，同学沟通，学习经验和方法。多与父母沟通，听听家人的意见。此外我也会经常跑步锻炼，释放压力并且放松心情。
